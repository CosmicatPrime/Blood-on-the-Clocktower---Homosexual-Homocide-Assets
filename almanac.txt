Bisexual
You start knowing the existence of a certain Minion role and a certain Townsfolk role that are in play.

Gay
You start knowing the existence of a certain Outsider role and how many steps away they are from you (or that none are in play). 

Multisexual
You are told that the Demon is one of two variations when the game begins.

Lesbian
	Once per game during the day, privately talk to the storyteller. Choose two players: you use your scissoring to cut ties between the two players, preventing them from using abilities on each other for the rest of the game.

Aroace
Each night* choose a player: they are safe from any debuffs granted by Minions or Outsiders tonight.

Genderfluid
	Twice per game, during the day, ask to speak to the storyteller privately. Choose two players: they swap seats.

Intolerant
	Once per game during the game, publicly choose a player. If that player is a Minion, they are executed and lose their vote token.

Non-Binary
	Each night, choose a player: if they are a Minion or an Outsider, their ability is disabled until the next night.
	
Gaydar
	Each night, choose two players: you learn if either is a Minion.

Pansexual
Each night, you learn how many of the two farthest players from you are evil. If there is an even number of people, this affects the neighbors of the farthest person from you.

Omnisexual
	Each night*, you learn how many dead players are evil.

Neurosexual
	Each night*, you discover one Minion role that is not in play.

Agender
	Every other night, you learn how many players’ abilities worked incorrectly last night and why.

Straight Shooter
When you find out that you died, choose a player: If they are the Demon, they die.

Polysexual
	You start knowing that at least two of three certain players are of the same alignment. You might be told who is of the same alignment later on.

Bottom
	Each night, choose a player: That player is your top until the next night. If that player dies the next day, you die as well.

Closeted
If you are ever “mad” about being the closeted, you lose your ability to vote normally and are instead given one vote token.

Ally
While you are alive, your alive neighbors might register as good and as a Townsfolk or Outsider.

Thot Daughter
	Each night, choose a player: if they are good, they are drunk tonight and tomorrow.

Polygamy
	You might register as a different alignment for every person with an information role.

Questioning
	You think you are a certain Townsfolk, but you are not. You might register as evil and as a Minion or a Demon. Later on, you might learn that you are the Questioning.

“Gay” Best Friend
	Each night, you see the grimoire. [+1 Outsider]

Beard
	Any and all abilities that would normally target the Demon will instead target you. You might register as evil and as a Minion or a Demon. This effect lasts until you die.

Politician
Once per game during the day, ask to privately speak to the storyteller. Choose a player. From now on, they will register as evil and as a Minion or a Demon.

Bigot
	Whenever a Townsfolk is executed, every good player who voted is poisoned until tomorrow day.

Uncle Sam
	On the first night, choose a player: They are poisoned tonight and tomorrow day. They might die later.

Homophobic Dad
	Each night*, choose a player: they die. On the first night, choose a player: They are now your son. If they are ever “mad” about their role or the fact that they are the son, they can only vote one more time for the rest of the game.

Mother Superior
Each night*, choose a player: they die. If you kill a Minion this way, you permanently gain their ability if it is still available to them.

Popular Kid
	Each night*, choose a player: they die. You might register as good and as a townsfolk or an outsider. You lose this ability if you are targeted by an information role.
